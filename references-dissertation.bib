Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.}",

abstract = {A brief review of the history of the experimental search for the neutron electric-dipole moment (EDM) is presented, followed by a discussion of the “state of the art” experimental techniques based on the storage of ultracold neutrons. Also discussed is the recent work on the construction of an improved experiment incorporating a 199Hg magnetometer within the ultracold neutron storage volume. We then review a number of well-known experimental and theoretical results and propose an entirely new experimental technique to search for the neutron EDM based on storing together, in superfluid 4He, polarized ultracold neutrons and a polarized gas of 3He atoms; this forms a unique system of two spins interacting by means of a spin-dependent mutual absorption. Such a system appears to be ideally suited for use in a neutron EDM search. Following a brief description of the method, we present an analysis of the dynamics of such a system and calculate the statistical uncertainties to be expected in an EDM search. We show that, in principle, improvement by a factor of over 1000 in the experimental limit is possible. This limit would be more than sufficient to determine whether the known CP violation leads to the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry and, in addition, would set very strict limits on the supersymmetric, multi-Higgs, and left-right-symmetric models of CP violation. We conclude with a discussion of some technical questions related to the proposed experimental technique.}

This apparatus uses superfluid 4He to produce a high density of Ultra-Cold Neutrons (UCN) which are contained in a suitably coated pair of measurement cells. The experiment, to be operated at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, uses polarized 3He from an Atomic Beam Source injected into the superfluid 4He and transported to the measurement cells where it serves as a co-magnetometer. The superfluid 4He is also used as an insulating medium allowing significantly higher electric fields, compared to previous experiments, to be maintained across the measurement cells. These features provide an ultimate statistical uncertainty for the EDM of 2−3× 10−28 e-cm, with anticipated systematic uncertainties below this level.}

The method provides a continuous on-line determination of the neutron polarization.

The entire magnetic field environment of the experiment has been analyzed using a finite-element model. Measurements of the magnetic field gradients and field direction have been carried out and the results are less than the upper limits required in the experiment. According to the results the compensated fields meet the stringent magnetic field requirements of the experiment defined by the systematic errors that have to be well below the statistical uncertainty of 10−8 in our main observable, the gamma asymmetry in neutron capture on hydrogen. We describe the design of the magnetic field, the construction of the compensation magnet, and we compare results of the field measurements with the results from the model.}

The technique developed and tested experimentally can be applied in several novel ways, e. g. for neutron spin flipper of superior characteristics, for a very high resolution spectrometer for direct determination of the Fourier transform of the scattering function, for generalised polarization analysis and for the measurement of neutron particle properties with significantly improved precision.},

The polarization achieved is consistent with known spin-exchange and spin-relaxation rates, but only when the recently discovered temperature dependence of 3He relaxation is included. Absolute 3He polarization measurements were performed using two different methods in two different laboratories. The results were obtained with either a spectrally narrowed laser or one type of broadband laser. Based on tests of several larger cells at pressures near 1 bar, we find that the power required to reach the same polarization is typically three times lower for the spectrally narrowed laser. This last result indicates that spectrally narrowed lasers will be important for obtaining the highest polarization in large volume neutron spin filters. Polarization in excess of 55\\% as obtained in cells up to 640 cm3 in volume and 70\\% polarization is anticipated with available increases in spectrally narrowed laser power.}",

The goal of the project was to enhance the NCNR polarized neutron measurement capabilities. Benefitting from more than a decade's development of spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP) at NIST, we planned to employ SEOP based 3He neutron spin filters for the polarized neutron scattering community. These 3He NSF devices were planned for use on different classes of polarized neutron instrumentation at the NCNR, including triple-axis spectrometers (TAS), small-angle neutron scattering instruments (SANS), reflectometers, and wide-angle polarization analysis. Among them, the BT-7 thermal TAS, NG-3 SANS, and MAGIK reflectometer have already been in the user program for routine polarized beam experiments. Wide-angle polarization analysis on Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer (MACS) has been developed for user experiments. We describe briefly the SEOP systems dedicated for polarized beam experiments and polarizing neutron development for each instrument class. We summarize the current status and polarized neutronic performance for each instrument. We present a 3He NSF hardware and software interface to allow for synchronization of 3He polarization inversion (neutron spin flipping) and free-induction decay (FID) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements with neutron data collection.}

As compared to our past results with lasers narrowed with diffraction gratings, we have observed between 5\\% and 11\\% fractional increase in the 3He polarization PHe. We also report a comparable improvement in PHe for two small cells, for which we would not have expected an increase from improved laser performance. In particular, prior extensive studies had indicated that the alkali-metal polarization was within 3\\% of unity in one of these cells. These results have impact on understanding the maximum PHe achievable by SEOP, whether the origin of the improvement is from increased alkali-metal polarization or decreased temperature-dependent relaxation. We conclude that the most likely explanation for the improvement in PHe is increased alkali-metal polarization. We have observed PHe of between 0.80 and 0.85 in several large cells, which marks a new precedent for the polarization achievable by SEOP.}",

The ratio of the current in the inner pair of coils to that in the outer pair must be I′/I=0.423 514. We compare the uniformity of the field produced by these coil systems with each other and with Rubens’ five‐coil system, both on and off axis. It is shown that the optimal four‐coil design is superior to the three‐ and five‐coil systems. The sensitivity of the uniformity to the precision of construction is discussed. Dimensions of regions around the center of the coil systems, uniform to 1 part in 106 to 1 part in 102, are given.}",

A comprehensive model has been developed for improved description of the combined effects of OP, ME, and relaxation, and of detailed MEOP features observed over the broad range of operating conditions. A brief description is provided, with illustrative comparisons of computed and experimental results. This improved tool is used to explain the excellent photon efficiency of OP obtained at all field strengths. It is combined with an angular momentum budget approach to quantitatively investigate the newly discovered strong OP-enhanced polarisation losses that currently limits MEOP performance.}

Interaction energies are determined using high-quality ab initio calculations for the states of the molecule that would be formed from each pair of atoms in their ground states. Potential energies are tabulated for a broad range of interatomic separation distances. The results show, for example, that the energy of an alkali interaction at small separations is nearly the same as that of a rare-gas interaction with the same electron configuration for the closed shells. Furthermore, the repulsive-range parameter for this region is very short compared to its length for the repulsion dominated by the alkali-valence electron at large separations (beyond about 3–4 a0). The potential energies in the region of the van der Waals minimum agree well with the most accurate results available. The ab initio energies are applied to calculate scattering cross sections and obtain the collision integrals that are needed to determine transport properties to second order. The theoretical values of Li–He total scattering cross sections and the rare-gas atom–He transport properties agree well (to within about 1\\%) with the corresponding measured data. Effective potential energies are constructed from the ab initio energies; the results have been shown to reproduce known transport data and can be readily applied to predict unknown transport properties for like-atom interactions.}",

The apparatus consists of a cylindrical 3He polarizer cell and wide-angle 3He analyzer cells, a vertical solenoid to provide a uniform magnetic field, and a shielded radio-frequency solenoid for the polarizer cell. Nuclear magnetic resonance is employed to reverse the polarization in the polarizer cell and monitor the 3He polarization in all cells. The first experiment using this apparatus was carried out with cylindrical analyzer cells with limited angular coverage due to low polarizations in fused quartz cells. We present results for aluminosilicate glass analyzer cells that cover 110 ∘ and have long relaxation times (100h to 400h). Using two 100W diode bars spectrally narrowed with chirped volume Bragg gratings, we have obtained 65% - 80% 3He polarization in these cells. The 3He polarization has been measured by neutron transmission and electron paramagnetic resonance. Additional progress includes an improved holding field solenoid and decreased spin-flip losses.}

abstract = {We present a detailed investigation into 3He neutron spin filter cells polarised by spin exchange optical pumping (SEOP). We include measurements of the absolute 3He polarisation using neutron transmission and characterisation of both the X-factor and 3He relaxation times (T1) for a number of cells. For one cell we calculated a maximum 3He polarisation of 79% with a T1 of 633h. The measured X-factor of this cell, X=0.17±0.01, is low. For all cells polarisations of >71% are observed. In addition we present 3He relaxation data for a new design of magneto-static cavity with a field of high homogeneity ΔB/B0≈3.5×10-4cm-1. This compact device provides a magnetic field in an orientation suitable for in situ optical pumping that minimises the field inhomogeneity contribution to the T1 to 930h in a 1bar cell, the longest reported on beam thus far. The results suggest that high 3He polarisation with long relaxation times can now be routinely obtained with SEOP, enabling time independent incident beam polarisation to be easily implemented across many different neutron scattering instruments.}

Above room temperature 3He dissolves into Pyrex, where interactions with Fe3+ ions result in a relaxation time of ≈1 ms. Gas exchange across the glass surface of an enclosed vessel leads to T1−1=A/V(3.9±1.4)×10−2 cm/h at room temperature, where A/V is the surface-to-volume ratio. The activation energy for relaxation is 13.7±0.7 kJ/mol and is dominated by the activation energy of 3He diffusion in glass. This is the first successful confirmation of predicted 3He relaxation rates in glass vessels.}

This paper will review four important effects that have come to light: 1) pumping with frequency narrowed diode lasers significantly improves the polarization and production rate as compared to off-the-shelf broadband sources 2) Rb-K mixtures again improve the production rate due to reduced collisional loss in K-He collisions, 3) a unexplained 3He wall relaxation mechanism that scales closely with alkali vapor pressure limits the attainable 3He polarization to about 80%, 4) a small collisionally-induced breakdown in the selection rules for optical pumping explains why narrowband lasers are so advantageous, and may explain some observed limitations for Rb-K pumping as well.}

The target is based on the technique of spin exchange optical pumping of hybrid rubidium and potassium and the highest polarization achieved is ∼ 62{\%} determined from both NMR-AFP and EPR polarimetries. The phenomenological parameter that reflects the additional unknown spin relaxation processes, X , is estimated to be ∼ 0.10 and the performance of the target is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. We also present beam test results from this new target cell and the comparison with the GE180 3He target cell used previously at HI{\$} {\backslash}gamma{\$}S.

The polarization was maintained over the course of several weeks, but the maximum attainable polarization declined over the course of a year-long run as the cell degraded, possibly due to long-term exposure to the neutron beam at high temperatures.

The latest spin-filter cells have wall relaxation times between 200 and 400h — the longest relaxation times yet achieved for valve-sealed cells. Recent results using 3He spin filters for reflectometry are presented and compared to the presently used supermirror-based polarisation analysers. By increasing the optical thickness of 3He gas, we move into a regime in which the neutron beam polarisation decays with a time constant of the order of a thousand hours and is thus negligible within the 24h time scale of an experiment. We present the performance of a 3He spin flipper, which inverts the polarisation direction of the 3He nuclei by adiabatic fast passage with a polarisation loss of 10−5 per flip. The development of in situ filling of the spin-filter cell via a capillary is described. This “local filling” technique enables 3He spin filters to be used in inaccessible regions, such as inside large-detector vacuum tanks and in high-radiation environments.}

abstract = {We describe here a method of performing adiabatic fast passage (AFP) spin flipping of polarized 3He used as a neutron spin filter (NSF) to polarize neutron beams. By reversing the spin states of the 3He nuclei the polarization of a neutron beam can be efficiently reversed allowing for the transmission of a neutron beam polarized in either spin state. Using an amplitude modulated frequency sweep lasting 500ms we can spin flip a polarized 3He neutron spin filter with only 1.8×10−5 loss in 3He polarization. The small magnetic fields (10–15G) used to house neutron spin filters mean the 3He resonant frequencies are low enough to be generated using a computer with a digital I/O card. The versatility of this systems allows AFP to be performed on any beamline or in any laboratory using 3He neutron spin filters and polarization losses can be minimised by adjusting sweep parameters.}

The classical adiabatic rapid passage, which is a fundamental element upon which all adiabatic pulses and sequences are based, is analyzed using vector models in different rotating frames of reference. Two methods to optimize adiabaticity are described, and ways to tailor modulation functions to best satisfy specific experimental needs are demonstrated. Finally, adiabatic plane rotation pulses and frequency-selective multiple spin-echo sequences are considered.}

Unfortunately, the usage of these compounds can also give rise to fast neutron emission with energies up to almost 16 MeV. Historically, some details in this fast neutron production mechanism can be absent from some modeling packages under some optimization scenarios. In this work, we tested Geant4 to assess the performance of this simulation toolkit for the fast neutron generation mechanism. We compare the results of simulations performed with Geant4 to available measurements. The outcome of our study shows that results of the Geant4 simulations are in good agreement with the available measurements for 6 Li fast neutron production, and suitable for neutron instrument background evaluation at spallation neutron sources.}

title = "{Position-sensitive detection of slow neutrons: Survey of fundamental principles}",
author = {Crawford, R K},
abstractNote = {This paper sets forth the fundamental principles governing the development of position-sensitive detection systems for slow neutrons. Since neutrons are only weakly interacting with most materials, it is not generally practical to detect slow neutrons directly. Therefore all practical slow neutron detection mechanisms depend on the use of nuclear reactions to ``convert`` the neutron to one or more charged particles, followed by the subsequent detection of the charged particles. The different conversion reactions which can be used are discussed, along with the relative merits of each. This is followed with a discussion of the various methods of charged particle detection, how these lend themselves to position-sensitive encoding, and the means of position encoding which can be applied to each case. Detector performance characteristics which may be of importance to the end user are discussed and related to these various detection and position-encoding mechanisms.},

abstract = {A range of solid state, scintillator and gas based detectors are being developed for use at the next generation of high flux neutron facilities. Since gas detectors are expected to continue to play a key role in future specific thermal neutron experiments, a comparison of the performance characteristics of prospective stopping gases is beneficial. Gas detectors typically utilize the reaction 3He(n,p)t to detect thermal neutrons; the 3He gas is used in a mixture containing a particular stopping gas in order to maintain relatively short ranges for the proton and triton pair emitted from the n-3He reaction. Common stopping gases include hydrocarbons (e.g. propane), carbon tetrafluoride, and noble gases such as argon and xenon. For this study, we utilized the Monte Carlo simulation code “Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter” to analyze the expected behavior of argon, xenon, carbon dioxide, difluoroethane and octafluoropropane as stopping gases for thermal neutron detectors. We also compare these findings to our previously analyzed performance of propane, butane and carbon tetrafluoride. A discussion of these gases includes their behavior in terms of proton and triton range, ionization distribution and straggle.}

abstract = {Accurately measuring the neutron beam polarization of a high flux, large area neutron beam is necessary for many neutron physics experiments. The Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline (FnPB) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is a pulsed neutron beam that was polarized with a supermirror polarizer for the NPDGamma experiment. The polarized neutron beam had a flux of ∼109 neutrons per second per cm2 and a cross sectional area of 10 × 12 cm2. The polarization of this neutron beam and the efficiency of a RF neutron spin rotator installed downstream on this beam were measured by neutron transmission through a polarized  3He neutron spin-filter. The pulsed nature of the SNS enabled us to employ an absolute measurement technique for both quantities which does not depend on accurate knowledge of the phase space of the neutron beam or the  3He polarization in the spin filter and is therefore of interest for any experiments on slow neutron beams from pulsed neutron sources which require knowledge of the absolute value of the neutron polarization. The polarization and spin-reversal efficiency measured in this work were done for the NPDGamma experiment, which measures the parity violating γ-ray angular distribution asymmetry with respect to the neutron spin direction in the capture of polarized neutrons on protons. The experimental technique, results, systematic effects, and applications to neutron capture targets are discussed.}

The neutronic performance of a hydrogen moderator depends on the ortho/para ratio of hydrogen, and thus experimental data are needed that will clarify the ortho/para ratio effects on neutronic performance. In this study, we measured the neutronic performance of a liquid hydrogen moderator at several para hydrogen concentrations. Our experiment was performed at the Hokkaido University 45meV electron linac facility. The neutron energy spectra were measured by the time-of-flight method. Pulse shapes were measured by the Bragg scattering of a mica crystal. The neutron energy spectra change within 20%, depending on the para hydrogen concentrations. With increasing para hydrogen concentration, the pulse peak intensity increases and the pulse width becomes narrower. Furthermore, for a decoupled moderator, the pulse decay becomes faster with increasing para hydrogen concentration. From a viewpoint of the figure of merit (FOM=I/FWHM2) the para hydrogen moderator showed almost the same performance as that of the solid methane moderator, which is considered to be a high performance moderator for pulsed neutron source.}

abstract = {The JSNS design criteria for the coupled hydrogen moderator requires a large number of beam lines. We therefore performed neutronic calculations to maximize time-integrated and pulse-peak intensities of low-energy neutrons for 100% para-hydrogen coupled moderators. It was found that a larger number of beam lines increased the total intensity due to the increase of the angular coverage although the average intensity of each beam line decreased a bit due to a finite reflector missing caused by the beam extraction holes in the reflector. In the case of a rectangular moderator, the spatial distribution of the vector flux of low-energy neutrons becomes undesirable at a large beam extraction angle (25∘). As an alternative, we propose a cylindrical moderator to substantially improve the spatial distribution. Time-integrated and pulse-peak intensities, pulse widths, and pulse decay characteristics were calculated as a function of the moderator diameter. The results indicated that the optimal diameter is about 140mm. Compared to the rectangular moderator, the cylindrical design gives higher pulse-peak intensities with narrower pulse widths, without penalizing the time-integrated intensities, thus providing a more uniform angle dependence. Some explanations are given for the differences in pulse characteristics between the two moderator shapes.}

In the single coil VAV AC system, conventional proportional-integral (PI) control algorithm is usually adopted to track the set-points of the room temperature and humidity by regulating the supply air flow rate and the chilled water flow rate, respectively. However, the control performance is usually not good due to the high coupling of the heat and mass transfer in the air-handling unit (AHU). A model-based control method is developed to realize the decoupling control of the room temperature and humidity according to the bilinear characteristics of the temperature and humidity variation. In this control method, a bilinear room temperature controller is used to track the room temperature set-point based on the real-time cooling load, while a room humidity controller is used to track the room humidity set-point depending on the real-time humidity load. The control performance was validated in a simulated VAV AC system. The test results show that comparing with the conventional PI control, the room temperature and humidity are controlled much more robustly and accurately by using the proposed model-based control method.}

From the observations we obtain the total cross section for UCN scattering by superfluid Helium. The temperature dependence of the total cross section is found to be consistent with calculations which include the effects of phonon absorption and phonon and roton scattering.},

The experimental technique utilizes scintillation light produced when neutrons react with 3He nuclei, and allows measurement of the 3He density integrated along  the trajectory of a well-defined neutron beam. By measuring the change in 3He density near a heater as a function of applied heat current, we are able to infer values for D with 20% accuracy. At temperatures below 0.7 K and for concentrations of order 10−4, we find D = [2.0+2.4−1.2]T−(6.5∓1.2) cm2/s, in agreement with a theoretical approximation.}

Measurements made with alpha (α) particle induced scintillations in gaseous argon (a broad band vacuum ultraviolet light source) were in good agreement with those made using the line source. Transparent scintillator doped plastic films have been developed which yield fluorescence efficiencies comparable to that of sodium salicylate. Evaporated films show the highest fluorescent yields, reaching almost four times the efficiency of sprayed sodium salicylate. On the other hand, doped plastic films offer some advantages.}

abstract = {We review the present status of the Standard Model calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This is performed in a perturbative expansion in the fine-structure constant α and is broken down into pure QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions. The pure QED contribution is by far the largest and has been evaluated up to and including O(α5) with negligible numerical uncertainty. The electroweak contribution is suppressed by (mμ∕MW)2 and only shows up at the level of the seventh significant digit. It has been evaluated up to two loops and is known to better than one percent. Hadronic contributions are the most difficult to calculate and are responsible for almost all of the theoretical uncertainty. The leading hadronic contribution appears at O(α2) and is due to hadronic vacuum polarization, whereas at O(α3) the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution appears. Given the low characteristic scale of this observable, these contributions have to be calculated with nonperturbative methods, in particular, dispersion relations and the lattice approach to QCD. The largest part of this review is dedicated to a detailed account of recent efforts to improve the calculation of these two contributions with either a data-driven, dispersive approach, or a first-principle, lattice-QCD approach. The final result reads aμSM=116591810(43)×10−11 and is smaller than the Brookhaven measurement by 3.7σ. The experimental uncertainty will soon be reduced by up to a factor four by the new experiment currently running at Fermilab, and also by the future J-PARC experiment. This and the prospects to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the near future – which are also discussed here – make this quantity one of the most promising places to look for evidence of new physics.}

abstract = { The new quantum mechanics, when applied to the problem of the structure of the atom with point-charge electrons, does not give results in agreement with experiment. The discrepancies consist of “duplexity ” phenomena, the observed number of stationary states for an electron in an atom being twice the number given by the theory. To meet the difficulty, Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck have introduced the idea of an electron with a spin angular momentum of half a quantum and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. This model for the electron has been fitted into the new mechanics by Pauli,* and Darwin,† working with an equivalent theory, has shown that it gives results in agreement with experiment for hydrogen-like spectra to the first order of accuracy. The question remains as to why Nature should have chosen this particular model for the electron instead of being satisfied with the point-charge. One would like to find some incompleteness in the previous methods of applying quantum mechanics to the point-charge electron such that, when removed, the whole of the duplexity phenomena follow without arbitrary assumptions. In the present paper it is shown that this is the case, the incompleteness of the previous theories lying in their disagreement with relativity, or, alternatetively, with the general transformation theory of quantum mechanics. It appears that the simplest Hamiltonian for a point-charge electron satisfying the requirements of both relativity and the general transformation theory leads to an explanation of all duplexity phenomena without further assumption. All the same there is a great deal of truth in the spinning electron model, at least as a first approximation. The most important failure of the model seems to be that the magnitude of the resultant orbital angular momentum of an electron moving in an orbit in a central field of force is not a constant, as the model leads one to expect. }

abstract = {We assess the status of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) in   light of the final Planck data release and other recent   developments, and in anticipation of future measurements.  Planck data from the recombination era fix the cosmic baryon   density to 0.9% precision, and now damping tail measurements   determine the helium abundance and effective number of neutrinos   with precision approaching that of astronomical and BBN   determinations respectively.  All three parameters are related by   BBN .  In addition, new high-redshift measurements give D/H to better   precision than theoretical predictions, and new Li/H data reconfirm   the lithium problem.  We present new 7Be(n,p)7Li rates using new   neutron capture measurements; we have also examined the effect of   proposed changes in the d(p,γ)3He rates.  Using these   results we perform a series of likelihood analyses.  We assess   BBN/CMB consistency, with attention to how our results depend on the   choice of Planck data, as well as how the results depend on   the choice of non-BBN, non-Planck data sets.  Most importantly   the lithium problem remains, and indeed is more acute given the very   tight D/H observational constraints; new neutron capture data   reveals systematics that somewhat increases uncertainty and thus   slightly reduces but does not essentially change the problem.  We   confirm that d(p,γ)3He theoretical rates brings D/H out of   agreement and slightly increases 7Li new experimental data are   needed at BBN energies.  Setting the lithium problem aside, we find   the effective number of neutrino species at BBN is Nν = 2.86 ± 0.15. Future CMB Stage\nobreakdash-4 measurements promise substantial   improvements in BBN parameters: helium abundance determinations will   be competitive with the best astronomical determinations, and   Neff will approach sensitivities capable of detecting the effects   of Standard Model neutrino heating of the primordial plasma.}

We also discuss the possibility of BAU generation by the electroweak processes themselves and find that this does not take place if the electroweak phase transition is of second order. No definite conclusion is made for the strongly first-order phase transition. We point out that the BAU might be attributed to the anomalous decays of heavy (MF⪆ MW/αW) fermions if these decays are unsuppressed.}

abstract = {A measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel is presented. This analysis is based on 35.9fb−1 of proton-proton collision data collected during the 2016 LHC running period, with the CMS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. A refined detector calibration and new analysis techniques have been used to improve the precision of this measurement. The Higgs boson mass is measured to be mH=125.78±0.26GeV. This is combined with a measurement of mH already performed in the H→ZZ→4ℓ decay channel using the same data set, giving mH=125.46±0.16GeV. This result, when further combined with an earlier measurement of mH using data collected in 2011 and 2012 with the CMS detector, gives a value for the Higgs boson mass of mH=125.38±0.14GeV. This is currently the most precise measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson.}

abstract = {The direct CP violation parameter Re(ϵ′/ϵ) has been measured from the decay rates of neutral kaons into two pions using the NA48 detector at the CERN SPS. The 2001 running period was devoted to collecting additional data under varied conditions compared to earlier years (1997–1999). The new data yield the result: Re(ϵ′/ϵ)=(13.7±3.1)×10−4. Combining this result with that published from the 1997, 98 and 99 data, an overall value of Re(ϵ′/ϵ)=(14.7±2.2)×10−4 is obtained from the NA48 experiment.}

abstract={We present an updated global fit of neutrino oscillation data in the simplest three-neutrino framework. In the present study we include up-to-date analyses from a number of experiments. Concerning the atmospheric and solar sectors, besides the data considered previously, we give updated analyses of IceCube DeepCore and Sudbury Neutrino Observatory data, respectively. We have also included the latest electron antineutrino data collected by the Daya Bay and RENO reactor experiments, and the long-baseline T2K and NO$\nu$A measurements, as reported in the Neutrino 2020 conference. All in all, these new analyses result in more accurate measurements of $\theta$13, $\theta$12, {\$}{\$} {\backslash}Delta {\{}m{\}}{\_}{\{}21{\}}^2 {\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$} {\backslash}left|{\backslash}Delta {\{}m{\}}{\_}{\{}31{\}}^2{\backslash}right| {\$}{\$}. The best fit value for the atmospheric angle $\theta$23 lies in the second octant, but first octant solutions remain allowed at ∼ 2.4$\sigma$. Regarding CP violation measurements, the preferred value of $\delta$ we obtain is 1.08$\pi$ (1.58$\pi$) for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering. The global analysis still prefers normal neutrino mass ordering with 2.5$\sigma$ statistical significance. This preference is milder than the one found in previous global analyses. These new results should be regarded as robust due to the agreement found between our Bayesian and frequentist approaches. Taking into account only oscillation data, there is a weak/moderate preference for the normal neutrino mass ordering of 2.00$\sigma$. While adding neutrinoless double beta decay from the latest Gerda, CUORE and KamLAND-Zen results barely modifies this picture, cosmological measurements raise the preference to 2.68$\sigma$ within a conservative approach. A more aggressive data set combination of cosmological observations leads to a similar preference for normal with respect to inverted mass ordering, namely 2.70$\sigma$. This very same cosmological data set provides 2$\sigma$ upper limits on the total neutrino mass corresponding to $\Sigma$m$\nu$ < 0.12 (0.15) eV in the normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering scenario. The bounds on the neutrino mixing parameters and masses presented in this up-to-date global fit analysis include all currently available neutrino physics inputs.},

ABSTRACT = {In this contribution, we summarise the determination of neutrino masses and mixing arising from global analysis of data from atmospheric, solar, reactor, and accelerator neutrino experiments performed in the framework of three-neutrino mixing and obtained in the context of the NuFIT collaboration. Apart from presenting the latest status as of autumn 2021, we discuss the evolution of global-fit results over the last 10 years, and mention various pending issues (and their resolution) that occurred during that period in the global analyses.},

title = "{nEXO: neutrinoless double beta decay search beyond 1028 year half-life sensitivity}",
journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {The nEXO neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay experiment is designed to use a time projection chamber and 5000 kg of isotopically enriched liquid xenon to search for the decay in 136Xe. Progress in the detector design, paired with higher fidelity in its simulation and an advanced data analysis, based on the one used for the final results of EXO-200, produce a sensitivity prediction that exceeds the half-life of 1028 years. Specifically, improvements have been made in the understanding of production of scintillation photons and charge as well as of their transport and reconstruction in the detector. The more detailed knowledge of the detector construction has been paired with more assays for trace radioactivity in different materials. In particular, the use of custom electroformed copper is now incorporated in the design, leading to a substantial reduction in backgrounds from the intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials. Furthermore, a number of assumptions from previous sensitivity projections have gained further support from interim work validating the nEXO experiment concept. Together these improvements and updates suggest that the nEXO experiment will reach a half-life sensitivity of 1.35 × 1028 yr at 90% confidence level in 10 years of data taking, covering the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass ordering, along with a significant portion of the parameter space for the normal ordering scenario, for almost all nuclear matrix elements. The effects of backgrounds deviating from the nominal values used for the projections are also illustrated, concluding that the nEXO design is robust against a number of imperfections of the model.}

abstract={The Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC (NEXT) searches for the neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$) decay of 136Xe using high-pressure xenon gas TPCs with electroluminescent amplification. A scaled-up version of this technology with about 1 tonne of enriched xenon could reach in less than 5 years of operation a sensitivity to the half-life of 0$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$ decay better than 1027 years, improving the current limits by at least one order of magnitude. This prediction is based on a well-understood background model dominated by radiogenic sources. The detector concept presented here represents a first step on a compelling path towards sensitivity to the parameter space defined by the inverted ordering of neutrino masses, and beyond.},

abstract = {The SNO+ experiment is located 2 km underground at SNOLAB in Sudbury, Canada. A low background search for neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay will be conducted using 780 tonnes of liquid scintillator loaded with 3.9 tonnes of natural tellurium, corresponding to 1.3 tonnes of 130Te. This paper provides a general overview of the SNO+ experiment, including detector design, construction of process plants, commissioning efforts, electronics upgrades, data acquisition systems, and calibration techniques. The SNO+ collaboration is reusing the acrylic vessel, PMT array, and electronics of the SNO detector, having made a number of experimental upgrades and essential adaptations for use with the liquid scintillator. With low backgrounds and a low energy threshold, the SNO+ collaboration will also pursue a rich physics program beyond the search for 0νββ decay, including studies of geo- and reactor antineutrinos, supernova and solar neutrinos, and exotic physics such as the search for invisible nucleon decay. The SNO+ approach to the search for 0νββ decay is scalable: a future phase with high 130Te-loading is envisioned to probe an effective Majorana mass in the inverted mass ordering region.}

The comparison is based on the analysis of the neutral-kaon semileptonic decays recorded in the CPLEAR experiment. There, the strangeness of the neutral kaon at time t=0 was tagged by the kaon charge in the reaction pp→K±π∓K0(K0) at rest, whereas the strangeness of the kaon at the decay time t=τ was tagged by the lepton charge in the final state. An average decay-rate asymmetry〈R(K0t=0→e+π−νt=τ)−R(K0t=0→e−π+νt=τ)R(K0t=0→e+π−νt=τ)+R(K0t=0→e−π+νt=τ)〉=(6.6±1.3stat±1.0syst)×10−3was measured over the interval 1τS<τ<20τS, thus leading to evidence for time-reversal non-invariance.}

abstract = {The imbalance of matter and antimatter in our Universe provides compelling motivation to search for undiscovered particles that violate charge-parity symmetry. Interactions with vacuum fluctuations of the fields associated with these new particles will induce an electric dipole moment of the electron (eEDM). We present the most precise measurement yet of the eEDM using electrons confined inside molecular ions, subjected to a huge intramolecular electric field, and evolving coherently for up to 3 seconds. Our result is consistent with zero and improves on the previous best upper bound by a factor of ~2.4. Our results provide constraints on broad classes of new physics above 1013 electron volts, beyond the direct reach of the current particle colliders or those likely to be available in the coming decades. The puzzling imbalance between matter and antimatter in the universe can be explained by the breaking of charge parity symmetry. The standard model of particle physics does predict a slight breaking of this symmetry but is insufficient to explain the observations. Many extensions to the standard model have been proposed to resolve this discrepancy. To test such model extensions, tabletop experiments that measure the electron’s electric dipole moment (eEDM), a measure of symmetry breaking, have looked very promising. Roussy et al. exploited the large electric fields inside the polar molecular ions of hafnium fluoride to measure the eEDM to extremely high precision (see the Perspective by Fan and Jayich). The uncertainty of the measurement compares favorably to those achievable through accelerator-based experiments. —JS Spectroscopy of molecular ions of hafnium fluoride was used to deduce the asymmetry of the electron’s charge distribution.}}

The interpretation of experimental EDM limits requires careful delineation of physics at a wide range of scales, from the long-range atomic and molecular scales to the short-distance dynamics of physics at or beyond the Fermi scale. In this review, we provide a framework for disentangling contributions from physics at these disparate scales, building out from the set of dimension four and six effective operators that embody CP violation at the Fermi scale. We survey computations of hadronic and nuclear matrix elements associated with Fermi-scale CP violation in systems of experimental interest and quantify the present level of theoretical uncertainty in these calculations. Using representative BSM scenarios of current interest, we discuss ways in which the interplay of physics at various scales can generate EDMs at a potentially observable level.}

abstract={The observed baryon asymmetry in the universe cannot be reconciled with the current form of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. The Standard Model breaks charge conjugation parity (CP) symmetry, but not in a sufficient amount to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. Historically one of the first systems to be studied in the search of symmetry breaking within the Standard Model is the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. The contribution to the neutron EDM coming from the SM is several order of magnitudes smaller than the current experimental bound, thus providing a unique, background-free window for potential discovery of physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The strong CP-violating {\$}{\$}{\backslash}theta {\$}{\$}term can also contribute to the neutron EDM, as can all the CP-violating effective operators describing, at energies below the electro-weak scale, the contributions from BSM. To constrain all these contributions to the neutron EDM we need to precisely determine the hadronic matrix elements of the corresponding renormalized operators. After a brief introduction on baryon asymmetry and baryogenesis, I summarize the current stuatus for experiments in search of a neutron EDM. I then describe in more details the different CP-violating sources, and some results in Chiral Perturbation Theory precede a discussion on the current status of Lattice QCD calculations. I will in particular focus on the 2 main challenges for these type of calculations: the signal-to-noise ratio and the renormalization. I will discuss several improvement techniques trying to improve these two aspects of the calculation and I will conclude with an optimistic view into the future.},

However, no beyond-the-SM (BSM) particles at the TeV scale have yet been detected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). With recent innovations, searches for time-reversal symmetry (T) violation through low-energy precision measurements of electric dipole moments (EDMs) of atoms and molecules have attained the sensitivity to detect indirect signatures of certain particles with masses of more than{\thinspace}{\thinspace}10{\thinspace}TeV c--2. In this Perspective, we discuss recent developments in the measurement and interpretation of EDMs, and assess proposed techniques for future experiments that could push experimental limits on T-violating BSM physics to the PeV scale.},

abstract = { § 1. It was shown by Bothe and Becker that some light elements when bombarded by α-particles of polonium emit radiations which appear to be of the γ-ray type. The element beryllium gave a particularly marked effect of this kind, and later observations by Bothe, by Mme. Curie-Joliot and by Webster showed that the radiation excited in beryllium possessed a penetrating power distinctly greater than that of any γ-radiation yet found from the radioactive elements. In Webster’s experiments the intensity of the radiation was measured both by means of the Geiger-Müller tube counter and in a high pressure ionisation chamber. He found that the beryllium radiation had an absorption coefficient in lead of about 0·22 cm.-1 as measured under his experimental conditions. Making the necessary corrections for these conditions, and using the results of Gray and Tarrant to estimate the relative contributions of scattering, photoelectric absorption, and nuclear absorption in the absorption of such penetrating radiation, Webster concluded that the radiation had a quantum energy of about 7 × 106 electron volts. Similarly he found that the radiation from boron bombarded by α-particles of polonium consisted in part of a radiation rather more penetrating than that from beryllium, and he estimated the quant um energy of this component as about 10 X 106 electron volts. These conclusions agree quite well with the supposition that the radiations arise by the capture of the α-particle into the beryllium (or boron) nucleus and the emission of the surplus energy as a quantum of radiation. The radiations showed, however, certain peculiarities, and at my request the beryllium radiation was passed into an expansion chamber and several photographs were taken. No unexpected phenomena were observed though, as will be seen later, similar experiments have now revealed some rather striking events. The failure of these early experiments was partly due to the weakness of the available source of polonium, and partly to the experimental arrangement, which, as it now appears, was not very suitable. }

This target is designed for a broad program of physics employing high intensity polarized photons and a polarized 3He target as an effective polarized neutron target. We report the performance of this target based on the technique of spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP). Due to the significantly larger photon beam size at the HIγS facility than that of a typical electron beam at electron accelerator laboratories, the HIγS 3He target contains a larger number of 3He nuclei than any polarized 3He targets reported previously. A target polarization on the order of 33–46% has been achieved from both a regular 3He–Rubidium (Rb) target and a hybrid target which contains a mixture of Rb and potassium. The target polarization has been determined within 3% using both the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) technique and the NMR–AFP (Adiabatic Fast Passage) technique.}

title = "{JCNS Workshop on Modern Trends in Production and Applications of Polarized  3He}",
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Polarized neutron scattering techniques are an indispensable and highly requested tool for studying magnetic phenomena in condensed matter. The different coherent and incoherent scattering of isotopes such as protons and deuterons also allows applications of polarized neutrons in soft matter and biological studies of molecular and macromolecular dynamics.
One method to polarize neutrons is to use polarized  3He gas which absorbs, or filters, one spin state of the neutron beam as it passes through it. Only about ten years ago, early polarized neutron scattering experiments using such  3He neutron spin filters (3He NSF) were being conducted using starting  3He polarizations of 55%. Currently there are two different commonly used methods to polarize high quantities of  3He. These methods both collisionally transfer spin polarization to ground state  3He nucleuses; one method uses optical pumping of an excited metastable state of  3He atoms, and the other uses optical pumping of the ground state of an alkali-metal vapour. Within the last decade immense progress in both methods has resulted in  3He polarizations of up to 80% being reported in atmosphere-pressure  3He cells by the world's leading labs.
This progress in optical pumped  3He promises to give rise to much more efficient and novel polarized neutron scattering experiments as and also impacts other areas of science. Polarized  3He is additionally applied in research fields such as particle physics, fundamental studies and medicine. Thus not only the techniques and methods of polarization, but the research groups themselves exploring polarized  3He, have a large breadth and diversity spanning different fields of science and locations in the world. Given this diversity, it is rare for this community to meet as a group at any one meeting or conference.
Because it is crucial to discuss new developments in  3He polarization in a multi-disciplinary international setting, an international workshop on "Modern Trends in Production and Applications of Polarized  3He" was held from 11–13 July 2010 in Ismaning, Germany. This workshop was organized by the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS) as part of our ongoing series of topic-oriented JCNS workshops relating to specific activities of the JCNS. In particular this JCNS workshop discussed the techniques of polarization of  3He,  3He containers, magnetic holding systems,  3He spin manipulations and applications in neutron scattering, medicine and physics.
The workshop was very well attended with intense discussions and inspiring presentations. In many ways the current workshop was a conceptual descendent of the HELION workshop in 2002 in Mainz, Germany. It is the hope of both us and many of the participants that such a workshop will be held again, perhaps 3 to 4 years in the future.
The current proceedings is a collection of papers written within the spirit of the workshop to provide a documentation of the current status and perspectives in the polarization of  3He and its applications.

    abstract = { The steady progress of physics requires for its theoretical formulation a mathematics that gets continually more advanced. This is only natural and to be expected. What, however, was not expected by the scientific workers of the last century was the particular form that the line of advancement of the mathematics would take, namely, it was expected that the mathematics would get more and more complicated, but would rest on a permanent basis of axioms and definitions, while actually the modern physical developments have required a mathematics that continually shifts its foundations and gets more abstract. Non-euclidean geometry and non-commutative algebra, which were at one time considered to be purely fictions of the mind and pastimes for logical thinkers, have now been found to be very necessary for the description of general facts of the physical world. It seems likely that this process of increasing abstraction will continue in the future and that advance in physics is to be associated with a continual modification and generalisation of the axioms at the base of the mathematics rather than with a logical development of any one mathematical scheme on a fixed foundation. There are at present fundamental problems in theoretical physics awaiting solution, e.g., the relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics and the nature of atomic nuclei (to be followed by more difficult ones such as the problem of life), the solution of which problems will presumably require a more drastic revision of our fundamental concepts than any that have gone before. Quite likely these changes will be so great that it will be beyond the power of human intelligence to get the necessary new ideas by direct attempts to formulate the experimental data in mathematical terms. The theoretical worker in the future will therefore have to proceed in a more indirect way. The most powerful method of advance that can be suggested at present is to employ all the resources of pure mathematics in attempts to perfect and generalise the mathematical formalism that forms the existing basis of theoretical physics, and after each success in this direction, to try to interpret the new mathematical features in terms of physical entities (by a process like Eddington’s Principle of Identification). }

abstract = {Supermirrors with large critical angles of reflection, i.e. large index m are an essential ingredient to transport, focus and polarise neutrons over a wide range of energy. Here we summarise the recent developments of supermirror with very large critical angles of reflection and high reflectivity that were conducted at SwissNeutronics as well as their implementation in devices. Approaching critical angles m = 8 times the critical angle of natural nickel makes new applications possible and extends the use of reflection optics towards the regime of hot and epithermal neutrons. Based on comparisons of simulations with experiment we demonstrate future possibilities of applications of large-m supermirrors towards devices for neutrons with short wavelength.}

abstract = {We present an absolute 3He polarimetry method based on thermal neutron transmission for a double-chambered cell. This method utilizes the fact that a 3He nucleus has a large absorption cross section and a spin dependence for thermal neutrons. The cell had a pumping chamber and a target chamber. Polarized 3He gas was produced in the pumping chamber by SEOP and then diffused into the target chamber. The 3He polarization in the target chamber was determined by comparing the neutron transmissions with the polarized and unpolarized targets. The measurement was performed at the RIKEN Accelerator-Driven Compact Neutron Source. The 3He polarization in the target chamber was determined with a statistical error of 1.8% and systematic uncertainty of 0.6%. This method can be used to obtain high-precision data of spin observables in few-nucleon scattering for the investigation of nuclear forces.}

abstract = {A new micro in situ polarized 3He neutron spin filter has been custom built for use as a neutron polarizer on the Dimensional Extreme Magnetic Neutron Diffractometer (DEMAND) at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). The 3He is polarized via spin-exchange optical pumping with a high-power fiber-coupled laser. The 3He neutron spin filter polarizer is designed to be compact in size with the length along the neutron beam only 30 cm because of the limited space available on the beamline. The polarizer is used for the shorter wavelength neutrons (1.005 Å and 1.546 Å) at DEMAND. A 3 bar 3He cell was filled to provide enough opacity so that good neutron polarization can be attained. At DEMAND the polarizer is mounted on an Automated Polarizer Changeover system (APCS) enabling quick switching between polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction.}

We report a design of a magnetically shielded solenoid that significantly improves the transverse field gradient averaged over a volume of 1000 cm3 by placing compensation coils around the holes in the mu-metal end caps rather than the conventional design in which the compensation coils are placed on the main solenoid. Our application is polarized 3He-based neutron spin filters, and our goal was to minimize the volume-averaged transverse field gradient, thereby the gradient induced relaxation time, over a 3He cell. For solenoids with end cap holes of different sizes, additional improvements in the field gradient were accomplished by introducing non-identical compensation coils centered around the non-identical holes in the end caps. The improved designs have yielded an overall factor of 7 decrease in the gradient in the solenoid, hence a factor of 50 increase in the gradient induced relaxation time of the 3He polarization. The results from both simulation and experiments for the development of several such solenoids are presented. Whereas our focus is on the development of magnetically shielded solenoids for 3He neutron spin filters, the approach can be applied for other applications demanding a high level of field homogeneity over a large volume.}",

For neutron scattering applications we often rely on µ-metal cavities to provide a degree of shielding from the many other sources of magnetic fields and gradient experienced on a typical neutron instrument. The JCNS utilizes two concepts for such cavities, one based on inexpensive plastic-bonded magnets to provide magnetic flux, and the other based on field coils wound on the sides of the µ-metal cavity. 2 different sized of permanent magnet cavities and three different geometries of coil-based cavities have been produced. Both types of boxes will be presented with magnetic design as well as mechanical construction details along with the achieved performance of the constructed devices.}

abstract = { The relativity quantum theory of an electron moving in a given electromagnetic field, although successful in predicting the spin properties of the electron, yet involves one serious difficulty which shows that some fundamental alteration is necessary before we can regard it as an accurate description of nature. This difficulty is connected with the fact that the wave equation, which is of the form [W/c + e/c A0 + ρ1 (σ, p + e/c A) + ρ3mc] Ψ = 0, (1) has, in addition to the wanted solutions for which the kinetic energy of the electron is positive, an equal number of unwanted solutions with negative kinetic energy for the electron, which appear to have no physical meaning. Thus if we take the case of a steady electromagnetic field, equation (1) will admit of periodic solutions of the form Ψ = u e-iEt/h, (2) where u is independent of t, representing stationary states, E being the total energy of the state, including the relativity term mc2. There will then exist solutions (2) with negative values for E as well as those with positive values ; in fact, if we take a matrix representation of the operators ρ1σ1, ρ1σ2, ρ1σ3, ρ3 with the matrix elements all real, then the conjugate complex of any solution of (1) will be a solution of the wave equation obtained from (1) by reversal of the sign of the potentials A, and either the original wave function or its con­jugate complex must refer to a negative E. }

pages={51-55},
abstract={The standard model of particle physics describes the vast majority of experiments and observations involving elementary particles. Any deviation from its predictions would be a sign of new, fundamental physics. One long-standing discrepancy concerns the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a measure of the magnetic field surrounding that particle. Standard-model predictions1 exhibit disagreement with measurements2 that is tightly scattered around 3.7 standard deviations. Today, theoretical and measurement errors are comparable; however, ongoing and planned experiments aim to reduce the measurement error by a factor of four. Theoretically, the dominant source of error is the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization (LO-HVP) contribution. For the upcoming measurements, it is essential to evaluate the prediction for this contribution with independent methods and to reduce its uncertainties. The most precise, model-independent determinations so far rely on dispersive techniques, combined with measurements of the cross-section of electron--positron annihilation into hadrons3--6. To eliminate our reliance on these experiments, here we use ab initio quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics simulations to compute the LO-HVP contribution. We reach sufficient precision to discriminate between the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the predictions of dispersive methods. Our result favours the experimentally measured value over those obtained using the dispersion relation. Moreover, the methods used and developed in this work will enable further increased precision as more powerful computers become available.},

abstract = {The level structure of 158Gd has been studied using the prompt γ-rays and conversion electrons emitted following neutron capture in 157Gd. The γ-ray energy and intensity measurements were made using both Ge(Li) detectors and a curved-crystal spectrometer. Conversion-electron energy and intensity measurements were made using two separate magnetic spectrometers: one to measure the primary electron spectrum and the other to measure the lower energy secondary electron spectrum. Some γ-γ coincidence measurements were also made among the secondary γ-rays. From these data, a neutron separation energy of 7937.1 ± 0.5 keV has been determined for 158Gd. A level scheme containing 59 excited states with energies < 2.25 MeV, for which de-excitation modes have been identified, is proposed for 158Gd. Many of these states have been grouped into rotational bands. A total of thirteen excited rotational bands with band-head energies below 2.0 MeV are contained in the level scheme. Features of the proposed level scheme include: the Kπ = 0−, 1− and 2− octupole-vibrational bands with band-head energies of 1263, 977 and 1793 keV, respectively; the γ-vibrational band at 1187 keV; three excited Kπ = 0+ bands with band-head energies of 1196, 1452 and 1743 keV; several two-quasiparticle bands with band-head energies in keV (and Kπ assignments) of 1380 (4+), 1636 (4−), 1847 (1+), 1856 (1−), 1920 (4+) and 1930 (1+). An analysis of (d, p) reaction data is presented which permits definite two-quasiparticle configuration assignments to be made to most of these latter bands. Evidence is presented which suggests strong mixing of some two-neutron and two-proton bands. A phenomenological four-band mixing analysis is made of the energy and E2 transition-probability data for the ground-state band and the three lowest-lying excited collective positive-parity bands. Good agreement with experiment is obtained. A Coriolis-mixing analysis of the octupole bands has been carried out and good agreement with the data on level energies and E1 transition probabilities to the ground-state band has been achieved. Values of Z, the ratio of the E1 transition matrix element with ΔK = 1 to that with ΔK = 0, involving the octupole bands and the first four 0+ bands are derived. For three of these 0+ bands, absolute values of these matrix elements are deduced. An interesting alternation in the sign of Z is observed for these four 0+ bands.}

    abstract = { We have recently developed a method by which the high speed particles associated with penetrating radiation can be made to take their own cloud photographs. By this means it is possible to obtain these photographs very much more speedily than by the usual method of making expansions at random. For when this latter method is used it is only on a small fraction of the photographs that a track will be found. The average number of photographs required to obtain one track will depend on the size and orientation of the chamber and on the effective time of expansion. The latter is not likely to be more than 1/20 second. From measurements with counters it is known that about 1·5 fast particles fall, from all directions, on 1 sq. cm. per second. Roughly consistent with these figures are the results found with cloud chambers. Skobelzyn has obtained as many as one track every ten expansions, but in the work of Anderson the number of tracks which were long enough to be suitable for energy measurements was only about 1 in 50 photographs. By our method, tracks are found on 80 per cent, of the photographs. We intend to give a full account of the technique of this method of photography in a separate paper, confining ourselves here to a rough outline only. A cloud chamber of diameter 13 cm. and depth 3 cm. is arranged with its plane vertical and two Geiger-Müller counters, each 10 cm. by 2 cm. are placed one above and one below the chamber so that any ray which passes straight through both counters will also pass through the illuminated part of the chamber, fig 2. An alternative arrangement is described on p. 719. The counters are connected to a valve circuit arranged to record only simultaneous discharges of the two counters. }

journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {Ultra-cold neutrons (UCN), i.e., neutrons with energy low enough that they undergo total reflection from a given surface at any angle of incidence, can be stored in magnetic and material bottles for periods ranging up to the neutron beta -decay lifetime ( approximately 103 s). Starting with a discussion of the theoretical and historical background the development of the field is reviewed from the first experimental observations to the present time with emphasis on the most recent developments and the remaining unsolved problems. The production and transport of UCN is discussed as well as their applications, and the direction that future developments are likely to take.}

author = {Rene Brun and Fons Rademakers},
abstract = {The ROOT system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. ROOT written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical OO database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with ROOT via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The OO database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes.}
